# Power Detector Parameters

# Power detector offsets. These parameters are used to offset the measured RF power in 40MHz and 80MHz channels.
# This is needed for some RF front end designs that have a shift in measured power for wider bandwidth channels.
# 20MHz channels are assumed to have zero offset as the PA parameters are usually computed using 20MHz channels.

# pdoffset40ma0, pdoffset40ma1, and pdoffset40ma2 are the offsets for 5GHz, 40MHz channels, for chains 0-2.
# Each number is a 16-bit wide field that is broken up into four 4-bit offsets, one for each sub-band of 0-3.
# Sub-band 3 (X1) is in bits [15:12], sub-band 2 (high) in bits [11:8], sub-band 1 (mid) in bits [7:4], and sub-band 0 (low) in bits [3:0]
# Each offset is stored in twos compliment format. Units are 1/4 dB.
# Ex: 0x0500 = +1.25dB offset for sub-band 2, that is 1.25dB is added to the measured power to get the correct measured power.

# Each offset is stored in twos compliment format. Units are 1/4 dB.

# Power-Per-Rate settings:

# General notes on these parameters:
#  - real_max_power[chain, rate] = max_power[chain] - total_power_offset[rate]
#  - The power offsets are in units of 0.5dB.
#  - Some offsets are signed offsets. Others are unsigned. Unless explicitly stated, offsets are unsigned.
#  - For sromrev=11, 11n rates mcs8-mcs15 and mcs16-mcs23 will have the same power-per-rate offsets corresponding to
#    mcs0-mcs7. Thus the power-per-rate offsets on each chain are not dependent on of the number of data streams.
#  - 11ac rates mcs0-mcs9 will have the same power-per-rate offsets on each chain irrespective of the number of streams.
#
